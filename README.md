The *__Local Youth Centre__* is a site that hopes to help parents with their kids to fit-in to the society, without allot of unnecessary struggling with daily routines, which soemtimes gives less motivation regarding family unity (the struggle will always be there - but the Youth Centre want's to losend it up a bit and make it less painful... nobody said that life is easy - especially rasing youth's, but help is here)...
In short words, we would like to help parents to keep focus on their family without splitting it up - because of work and other necessary routines.
Together, and with other adults - we can build a great world for our kids - for a better and brighter future.

# Testing

The site has been tested within the timeline and resources given, on different devices and different browser.
Tools as jigsaw.w3.org, valitator.w3.org, webaccessability.com, caniuse.com and diffchecker, plus more have been used to ensure a stable site -before deployment.

Media queries for smal screen size's has solved all opened normal issues before deployment.

One open minor Issue - to be postsponed and lifted out oh this deployment is: 
1. On very, very small devices that opens the site from the "Facebook Messenger APP", the alignment on the site differs comparing to other browsers(so it seems like the APP uses it's own browser?).
  *  This can be solved now and after deployment, by adding media queries for any devise that shows this issue (ie. user reports the "error").
  *  Most likely, we will get no report from users regarding this "bug" (chanses of this scenario is minor).
  *  Most likely, the amount of users getting this "error" is minor and workaround exists.
     - To get past this issue (if a user gets the site link posted on the messenger APP and has a tiny devise) - then the user can open site on another browser.
     - Another browser would be like ex. "open page on samsung internet" for a samsung smartphone (with a very very small screen).
  *  So with a first line support, the answer (work around) would be to tell the user to open in other browser.
  *  A secondline support could solve the bug easy (if reported).

Whit all this above issue considered, the best option is to push this release and see if a fix can be implemented later on.
